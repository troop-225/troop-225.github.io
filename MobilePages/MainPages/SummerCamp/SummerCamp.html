                <a>Summer camp at Seven Ranges Scout Reservation is a week long camping experience that is the highlight of our Scouting year. We hope that every Scout will be able to attend. For more details about the Buckeye Council and Seven Ranges Scout Reservation please visit their web site here.<br /><br />
                This summer, our scouts will have the opportunity to earn merit badges, learn and practice many outdoor skills, and participate in all kinds of supervised outdoor activities. It is a great opportunity for the boys to meet and interact with approximately 450 other Scouts from across Ohio and many neighboring states. 
                Summer camp provides opportunities to participate in many activities, such as swimming, boating, Scout-craft, handicrafts, ecology and conservation, archery, rifle, and shotgun shooting and many other activities.<br /><br />
                Scouts participating in this year's Pipestone Camp Honors Program should be preparing well in advance. To participate, scouts must meet advancement requirements. All advancements must be done before we go to summer camp, including scoutmaster conference and boards of review. Please click on the Pipestone Tab above for specific requirements.<br /><br /><br />
                All Scouts are required to have a physical exam within 3 years. If the troop has a file copy of your sons medical form and the physical was within 3 years, the form must be verified and signed by a parent.<br /><br />
                Scouts should begin to gather Pipestone wood, and work on other Pipestone requirements. Pipestone wood should be approved before we go to camp.<br /><br />
                Make sure any medications needed are packed and listed on the medical form. Scouting regulations dictate Scouts are responsible for taking their medication. Adults will remind scouts only if contacted by the parents AND provided with WRITTEN instructions with name, dosage, and delivery time. <br /><br />
                All scouts and leaders should be in full class “A” uniform at check-in on Sunday. We will take a group photo, and supply a copy to each scout. Scouts should wear swim trunks under their uniform shorts. (Do not pack away with the rest of your gear.) A swim test will be administered immediately following check-in.<br /><br />
                Scouts are not permitted to call home while at camp (unless it is an emergency). You will have an address to write, along with an emergency phone number. It may take considerable time to reach a Scout to relay an emergency phone message depending on the time of day and program activities. Scouts should not bring cell phones. Adults should not count on cell phones working in this remote area. <br /><br />
                Permission slips must be returned by the Tuesday prior to camp. <br /><br />
