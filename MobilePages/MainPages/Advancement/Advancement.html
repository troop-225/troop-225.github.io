                <h1><b>General</b><br /></h1>
                <a>Part of the scouting program is developing the courage of a scout to ask people for help and developing the personal responsibility and accountability of the scout as he plans and completes the various requirements. 
                Many opportunities will be presented to the scout for training and completion of various requirements. 
                He must follow through and get the requirements signed-off. 
                Parents may work with their scout at home to prepare them for requirements, but should allow the scout to make all arrangements for completion of requirements, scout master conferences, boards of review, service projects and merit badges. 
                Parents are not able to sign-off any of the boy scout requirements.<br /><br /></a>
            </div>
            <div class="scoutRequirements">
                <h1><b>Scout Requirements</b><br /></h1>
                <a>When a scout is ready to complete the scout rank requirements, he should contact the scoutmaster for a scoutmaster conference. During the scoutmaster conference, the scoutmaster will review all of the requirements with the scout to verify successful completion. 
                Unlike cub scouts and Webelos, parents are not able to sign-off any of the boy scout requirements.<br /><br /></a>
            </div>
            <div class="rankRequirements">
                <h1><b>Tenderfoot, Second Class and First Class Requirements</b><br /></h1>
                <a>Many of the rank requirements for tenderfoot, second class and first class are presented in the regular troop meetings and at the monthly troop campouts. 
                Scouts should practice what they have learned and be able to demonstrate understanding of the requirement before they attempt to have someone sign them off on the requirement. 
                It is the responsibility of the scout to complete requirements and to get them signed-off. 
                All requirements should be only signed-off by <i>boy scouts over first class rank*</i>, troop leaders, or adult leaders that have observed the scout doing the requirement. 
                Individuals that sign-off on a requirement must be competent in the requirement.  (* preferred)<br /><br /></a>
            </div>
            <div class="scoutmasterConferences">
                <h1><b>Scoutmaster Conferences</b><br /></h1>
                <a>Any boy who has completed all of the requirements for a rank, except the Demonstrating Scout Spirit, the Scoutmaster conference, and the Board of Review - the last three requirements for each rank, should call the scoutmaster for a scoutmaster conference. 
                Scoutmaster conferences can be held at regular meetings, weekend campouts, or any other time, provided prior arrangements have been made with the scoutmaster.<br /><br />
                For a scoutmaster conference the scout must be dressed in full Class A uniform, including (but not limited to) a troop neckerchief with slide, scout shirt with appropriate badges of rank and green or dress pants.<br /><br />
                Scouts will be asked to demonstrate some of the rank requirements for the scoutmaster conference. Scouts going for Star, Life, or Eagle rank should talk to the scoutmaster and the advancement chair prior to the scoutmaster conference to discuss their participation and leadership requirements. 
                Scouts may be asked to study a requirement or work longer in a responsible leadership position, if the scoutmaster is of the opinion that the requirement was not completed or demonstrated successfully. 
                In such cases the scout will be asked to come to the scoutmaster when the scout is able to demonstrate successfully completion the deficient requirement.<br /><br /></a>
            </div>
            <div class="boardsOfReview">
                <h1><b>Boards of Review</b><br /></h1>
                <a>Scoutmaster conferences usually take place at least one week before the scout’s board of review. Typically there will be no boards of review the week before a court of honor, so the scout should plan on getting his scoutmaster conference and board of review completed for his rank advancement a few weeks prior to any court of honor. 
                Also, no scoutmaster conferences or boards of review will be held at summer camp. All advancement required for participation in the campership program must be completed prior to summer camp.<br /><br />
                Boards of review can only be scheduled after having the scoutmaster conference signed-off. The scout must call the advancement chairman to set up a board of review. This should be done on the Friday or Saturday prior to the Tuesday night meeting.<br /><br /></a>
            </div>
            <div class="meritBadges">
                <h1><b>Merit Badges</b><br /></h1>
                <a>The merit badge program is set up to allow the scout to not only complete the required badges for the Eagle Scout rank, but also to learn about a subject that may be of interest to him.<br /><br />
                To earn a merit badge the scout must:<br />
                1. Read the book. If the scout only downloads the requirements from a website he may miss out on information that the merit badge counselor will ask. Many merit badge books are available in our troop library. If the troop library doesn’t have the particular merit badge book, borrow one from the local public library or purchase one from the Greater Cleveland Council scout shop.<br />
                2. Ask the scoutmaster or the advancement chair for a merit badge blue card. Fill it out with personal information and the name of the merit badge. Have the scoutmaster sign the filled out blue card. <br />
                3. Ask the advancement chair for a name and phone number of a merit badge counselor.<br />
                4. Contact the counselor and complete the requirements. Always use the buddy system when visiting with a counselor!<br />
                5. After the requirements are completed and the counselor signs the merit badge as such, bring the completed card to the advancement chairman. He will record the successful completion and present the merit badge to the scout either at a meeting or a court of honor.<br /><br /></a>

            <div class="serviceProjects">
                <h1><b>Service Projects</b><br /></h1>
                <a>Service projects for Star and Life must be approved by the scoutmaster and be at least six hours of service.<br /><br />
                The Life project should be one that requires the scout to perform some planning and leadership. This will help prepare the scout for his Eagle project.<br /><br />
                Eagle service projects must be approved by the contact person or sponsor for the project, the scoutmaster, the troop committee chairman and the district advancement chairman. These approvals must be obtained prior to work starting on the project.<br /><br /></a>
